# First_Tkinter_project-miles-km-converter
My first project created by using Tkinter

Features:
  - Two way conversion (OptionMenu)
  - Input Entry only accept float (numerical and dot from keyboard) and empty value
  - Output is in Entry (readonly) so user can copy the result
  - Result is shown in real-time (updated every 5ms), converted directly from input value
